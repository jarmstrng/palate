==============

##The Problem
Our goal in creating this app was to make wine more accessible to your average wine drinker who may enjoy wine socially, but not know much about how to critically examine it.  Wine knowledge should not be limited to the hands of master sommeliers, but should be available to all who are interested.

Wine tastings foster the growth of genuine social connection and critical analysis skills, but depend on a leader to know each wine's characteristics.  This app removes that burden, giving each taster the opportunity to build on their own abilities within a group setting.

## Installation
Palate is built with a Rails backend. To set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/mud-turtles-2014/wine-tasting.git
```

Run bundle:

```
bundle install
```

Start the server:

```
rails s
```
