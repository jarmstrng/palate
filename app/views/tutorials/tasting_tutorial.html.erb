<h2>A Simple Guide to Tasting Wine</h2>

<h4>Before You Start</h4>
<p>Before you even begin, we suggest clearing the room around you of unnecessary sensory distractions.  If people are talking too loudly, it's difficult to concentrate.  If you're standing near what's cooking for dinner, the smells will confuse your nose and throw off your sense of the wine.  Just like food is best enjoyed when you can fully focus on it, so too is wine best enjoyed with all of your senses fully engaged.</p>

<h4>Appearance</h4>
<p>Start by taking a look at the wine's color.  Red wines aren't just marooon.  White wines aren't just gold.  What other colors do you see in your glass?  You can learn a lot about a wine from looking at its color, including: the type of grape used, the climate in which that grape was grown, and its age.</p>

<h4>Angles</h4>
<p>Tilting the glass and looking at it from different angles provide a different way in which you can determine the characteristics of a wine that relate to its appearance.  If you are concerned about its quality, a side view or a tilted view can also help determine if a wine is past its prime.<br>
<br>
Before you take that first sniff, give the wine a gentle swirl.  This action helps to aerate the wine, which will enhance its natural flavor and aroma to make it more detectable.

<h4>The Nose or Bouquet</h4>
<p>When you first smell the wine, don't bury your nose in the glass, but hover over it gently.  Take a few short sniffs as you think about what your nose is telling you.  Do you detect any fruit aromas?  You know that it contains grapes, but is there perhaps some lingering citrus scent?  Does it smell oaky or of any particular mineral?  Don't worry if you can't figure this out at first.  You'll get better with time.</p>
