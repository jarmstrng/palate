  <h2>How to Taste</h2>

  <h4>Pour a Taste</h4>
  <p>A full wine glass is 5 ounces. To taste, you want to pour about half of that, so you have space in your glass to swirl (more on this later).</p>

  <h4>The Nose</h4>
  <p>Swirl your glass. This isn't just to look fancy. Jancis Robinson explains:
    <blockquote cite="http://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/drinking-wine/how-to-become-a-wine-taster">Since a wine's flavour molecules are given off only on the liquid's surface, they can be seriously encouraged by maximizing the wine's surface area.</blockquote></p>
  <p>Put your entire nose in the glass and smell. Pay attention to the fruits, minerality, oak and other major components of tasting described below.</p>

  <h4>The Palate</h4>
  <p>This is the fun part. Take a large sip of the wine (don't be shy) and move the wine across your tongue. Slurping, like when you're drinking a hot beverage, helps aerate the wine in your mouth.</p>
  <p>Revisit the components of the wine: fruits, minerality, etc. Ask yourself whether what you're tasting maps onto what you smelled earlier.</p>
